# Migration Progress Log

Running log of the phases/2.0 Rust port. One entry per work session. The plan
docs (`00`–`04`) are the *design*; this file is the *state*.

Branch: `2.0`. Workspace: [`../../rust/`](../../rust/).

## Tagging discipline (2.0)

Every phase gets an **annotated** git tag when — and only when — its exit criteria
in [`03-PHASES.md`](03-PHASES.md) are met (parity harness green on the mixed stack,
golden diffs clean, `cargo fmt` + `clippy -D warnings` + `test` green). The tag is
the "phase done" gate — consistent with the repo's "verify first, commit after /
one commit per phase minimum."

**Scheme — phase pre-releases of the final `v2.0.0`:**

| Tag | Cut / gated on |
|---|---|
| `v2.0.0-phase.0` | Foundations: 7 platform crates + CI + golden rig; hello-world conformance passes |
| `v2.0.0-phase.1` | rating cut over (pilot); per-service playbook written |
| `v2.0.0-phase.2` | mediation + provisioning-sim + som cut over |
| `v2.0.0-phase.3` | catalog + com cut over |
| `v2.0.0-phase.4` | **bilingual resting point** — all 9 services Rust; portals/orch/CLI still Python. Shippable pause point (strategy §5); re-measure motto #6 for the service plane vs [`05-BASELINE.md`](05-BASELINE.md) |
| `v2.0.0-phase.5` | orchestrator lib + knowledge + cockpit-core (no deployable cutover; fixture-parity green) |
| `v2.0.0-phase.6` | portals (self-serve, csr) cut over |
| `v2.0.0-phase.7` | CLI + REPL + scenarios cut over |
| `v2.0.0` | **final cutover** — all-Rust, Alembic retired, 14-day soak passed (Phase 8) |

SemVer ordering holds: `2.0.0-phase.0 < 2.0.0-phase.1 < … < 2.0.0-phase.7 < 2.0.0`
(numeric pre-release identifiers order numerically; any pre-release precedes the
release). The major bump to `2.0.0` marks the platform rewrite even though wire
contracts are frozen (§3) — the migration is behaviour-frozen, not API-versioned.

**Mechanics:**
- `git tag -a v2.0.0-phase.N -m "<phase>: <what cut over>; exit criteria met (<evidence>)"` — annotated so the message records the exit-criteria evidence.
- Tag the commit on `2.0` that *completes* the phase (post-merge if the phase ran on a feature branch). **Mid-phase commits are never tagged** — e.g. this scaffold commit is *not* `phase.0`; that tag waits until all seven crates + CI + the golden rig are done.
- Intra-phase service cutovers (P2 ×3, P4 ×3) are **commits, not tags** (`feat(payment): rust cutover`); the phase tag caps the set. If one service must be pinned for a prod canary, use an incrementing pre-release: `v2.0.0-phase.4.1`, `.2`, `.3`.
- The Python parity baseline stays `v1.8.1` on mainline; every 2.0 tag is `v2.0.0-*`, so they never collide.

## Phase 4 — payment → subscription → crm — 🚧 IN PROGRESS

The big three, each its own cutover (03-PHASES §Phase 4). Ordered by blast radius.
The phase tag `v2.0.0-phase.4` caps the set after crm; intra-phase cutovers are commits.

### Phase 4a — payment — ✅ PORTED + CUT OVER (2026-07-12)

**payment** is ported and **cut over into the running stack** (Rust image, stripe-mode
— the live deployed config). Service plane is now Rust for rating + event plane +
catalog + com + payment; only subscription/crm remain Python. ~1.9k Rust LOC (14
modules) + the `PaymentClient` surface extension deferred to 4b (com only needs
`list_methods`, already present).

**Shape.** HTTP-only, like catalog — **no MQ, no relay**: the oracle's
`publisher.publish` only stages the `audit.domain_event` row (`published_to_mq=false`)
and returns; the lifespan opens no broker connection. `events::stage` replicates this
exactly. So payment is the simplest event-wise of the P4 trio.

**The tokenizer seam.** The oracle's `TokenizerAdapter` Protocol → a closed `Tokenizer`
enum (mock | stripe), avoiding an `async-trait` dep. Mock preserves the
`tok_FAIL_*`/`tok_DECLINE_*` decline affordances. **Stripe via direct reqwest
(Decision D4** — the Python `stripe` SDK doesn't port): PaymentIntent create
(`off_session`+`confirm`, `Idempotency-Key` header), customer ensure (cached in
`payment.customer`), attach/detach (test-card relink under `ALLOW_TEST_CARD_REUSE`),
retrieve card; every call recorded to `integrations.external_call` with the ported
`_redact_stripe`. **The live container is stripe-mode**, so this path is load-bearing
(not a mock-only shortcut). `select_tokenizer`'s four fail-fast startup guards ported
verbatim (unknown provider; missing creds; prod + `sk_test_*` / mode mismatch;
`ALLOW_TEST_CARD_REUSE` + `sk_live_*`).

**Webhooks.** The Stripe receiver (`/webhooks/stripe`, exempt from the token perimeter
by path) ports `bss_webhooks`: `_verify_stripe` (HMAC-SHA256 over `{t}.{body}`,
timestamp-skew, constant-time hex compare via `subtle`), `WebhookEventStore` dedup on
`(provider,event_id)`, and the routing — reconcile / **drift-not-overwrite** (webhook is
secondary truth) / refund + dispute **record-only** (motto #1). 5 signature unit tests.

**Money + datetime seams (P3 lessons, reused).** `amount` read as `amount::text` →
`Decimal`, rendered as a 2dp **string** on the wire; TMF response datetimes render `Z`
(micros only when non-zero) via a local `tmf_datetime`. Captured the live wire first.

**Verification.**
- fmt clean, clippy `-D warnings` clean, **15 payment unit tests** green (workspace 148 → 163).
- **Live golden diff** (`tests/live_smoke.rs`, `#[ignore]`): every read endpoint
  byte-identical to the Python oracle (payment single/list/filtered/count, paymentMethod
  single/list, both 404 envelopes); token perimeter matches (health exempt / 401 / 200).
- **Full hero suite run directly** against the whole stack with payment=mock (Rust):
  **15/19 PASS**, incl. all payment-critical ones (signup_and_exhaust 13/13, renews 18/18,
  roaming VAS, activation-with-retry). The 4 FAIL are portal-login/branding/Jaeger-trace
  scenarios (`/welcome` custom-branding text, `/auth/check-email` 400, `spanCount` None) —
  **verified to fail identically on the pure-Python-payment baseline**, so zero regression
  from the port (Playbook "red baseline = environment, not the port").
- Deployed container logs clean `INFO` (`service.starting … payment_provider=stripe`),
  `grep -icE 'password|PLAIN|NOT_ALLOWED|panic'` → 0.

**Deployment note (the P2/P3 gotcha, reconfirmed + worked around).** `portal-self-serve`
health-`depends_on` payment (+catalog/com/som), and the Rust images have **no HEALTHCHECK
until P8** — so `make scenarios-hero`'s provider-flip `--force-recreate portal-self-serve`
leaves the portal stuck in `Created` (its Rust deps never report "healthy"). Fix, as in
P2/P3: run scenarios **directly** (`bss scenario run[-all]`) with the overlay held, and
start the portal with `docker compose … up -d --no-deps portal-self-serve` to bypass the
gate. The `make scenarios-hero` path stays red on the Rust-heavy stack until P8 adds
binary healthchecks. Overlay "cut over so far" now includes payment.

**Next (4b): subscription** — highest correctness stakes (double-billing + quota math);
renewal worker, balance decrement under `FOR UPDATE`, price-snapshot renewal, VAS,
proptest the hypothesis balance suite.

---

## Phase 3 — catalog + com — ✅ COMPLETE (tag `v2.0.0-phase.3`)

Two services ported and **cut over into the running stack**. The service plane is
now Rust for rating + the event plane + catalog + com; only subscription/crm/payment
remain Python. ~4.6k Rust LOC across two crates + six new typed clients/methods.

**catalog** (HTTP-only — no MQ, no consumer, no audit/reset router; just a pool + an
optional `LoyaltyClient`): TMF620 read surface (offering/price/spec) + VAS + admin
writes (add-offering/window/retire/add-price) + the v1.1 **promotion subsystem** (the
two-system create saga over the external loyalty-cli, targeted assign/unassign,
exhaust, validate/preview/resolve reads). **com**: TMF622 ProductOrder FSM
(create → submit → completed/failed/cancelled), price snapshot at order time, the
v1.1 promo consume lifecycle at activation (claim → redeem / revoke), the outbox
relay + two safe consumers (`service_order.completed/failed`) + the reconciliation
sweeper.

**The R1 money seam (the headline of P3).** `rust_decimal` added to the workspace;
money columns (`NUMERIC`) are read as `amount::text` → `Decimal::from_str` so the 2dp
scale is preserved exactly. `apply_discount` (round-half-up to 2dp) and
`discount_label` (`normalize()` for "20% off"; `{:.2}` for "SGD 5.00 off") match
`bss_models.discount` byte-for-byte. Two **distinct datetime seams** now coexist and
must not be confused:
- **TMF response bodies** render `Z` (Pydantic v2 default: `2026-04-01T00:00:00Z`,
  fraction omitted when zero) — the `tmf_datetime` formatter in each service.
- **Event payloads + policy-message strings** render `+00:00` micros —
  `bss_clock::isoformat` (the P2 seam), e.g. the no-active-price 422 message.
- **Money on the wire is mixed:** TMF `Money.value` is a JSON **float** (`25.0`);
  `discountValue` / order `priceAmount` are Pydantic `Decimal` → JSON **strings**
  (`"20.00"`, `"25.00"`). A third subtlety: com's create path reproduces Python's
  `Decimal(str(value))` where `value` is a catalog JSON float — `Value::to_string()`
  gives the seed string "25.0" (not "25"), so the `order.acknowledged` event payload
  matches; the DB row then reads back "25.00".

**New clients (each partial to the calls the phase needs):** `LoyaltyClient` (its own
transport — bearer + `X-Actor-Id`/`Idempotency-Key`, `POST /v1/tools/<name>`, the
refusal-422 → `ClientError::Policy` envelope), `CrmClient::get_customer`,
`PaymentClient::list_methods`, `SomClient::list_for_order`,
`CatalogClient::{get_active_price, validate_promo, resolve_eligible_promo}`,
`SubscriptionClient::create`. Loyalty **is enabled** in this stack, so the promotion
saga runs live; catalog and com each hold their own client (token never leaves the
process).

**SOM P2 lock lesson applied.** com's consumer handlers read the order aggregate
`FOR UPDATE` and the safe consumer processes serially — the same serialize/lock
discipline the P2 SOM port introduced. (The **Python-side backport** of the SOM CFS
`pendingTasks` race is still owed; noted again here.)

**Validation.**
- **Golden diff (catalog):** the Rust catalog, booted in-process against the same
  live Postgres + loyalty, was diffed (`Value ==`, order-sensitive) against the live
  Python oracle across 20+ endpoints — every TMF620 read (list/filtered/activeAt/get/
  404), both price paths, specs, VAS, TMF671 promotions, and the live-loyalty promo
  reads (validate valid+invalid, preview, customer-offers) — **all byte-identical**.
  The only endpoint pulled out of the strict loop is the no-active-price 422, whose
  message carries `clock_now()` (differs by ms between two live calls); its shape
  matches (asserted field-by-field). com's read surface (order get/list/404) was
  golden-diffed the same way.
- **Write paths (catalog):** exercised inertly against the deployed Rust container
  (add-offering → add-price with `retire_current` rollover → active-price resolves to
  the new row → admin-gate 422 on anonymous actor), then cleaned up via psql.
- **Hero scenarios:** all six P3-relevant deterministic scenarios green against the
  confirmed all-Rust order plane (overlay held) — both named exit criteria
  (`catalog_versioning_and_plan_change`, `new_activation_with_provisioning_retry`)
  plus `customer_signup_and_exhaust`, `operator_adds_roaming_plan`,
  `customer_buys_roaming_and_uses_it`, `customer_renews_automatically`.
- **Deployed-log scan:** com + catalog both clean (`password|PLAIN|NOT_ALLOWED|panic|
  ERROR` → 0); com's two consumers + outbox relay start clean.

**Deployment gotcha (same as P2), with the clean workaround proven:** run scenarios
with `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.rust.yml` exported — the
provider-flip recreate (`up -d --force-recreate portal-self-serve crm payment`) then
resolves against the overlay and leaves the Rust images in place. Verified: all six
Rust services stayed Rust through the flip; payment/crm/portal recreated as Python.

### Phase 2 → Phase 3 (this work)

Tagged `v2.0.0-phase.2` → next was **Phase 4 (payment → subscription → crm)**.

---

## Phase 2 — Event-plane services: mediation, provisioning-sim, som — ✅ COMPLETE (tag `v2.0.0-phase.2`)

Three services ported and **cut over into the running stack**, plus the deferred
lapin/sqlx event-plane bindings (relay tick loop + safe retry/park consumer). The
order pipeline now runs on an all-Rust event plane (mediation → rating →
subscription; com → som → provisioning-sim → som → com) against the Python
catalog/com/subscription/crm/payment. **18/19 hero scenarios green** on the mixed
stack; the 1 failure is a pre-existing Python-portal branding assertion (see
below). 138 unit/integration tests (+42 over P1); fmt + clippy `-D warnings` clean.

### Done

- **`rust/services/mediation`** — TMF635 online mediation. Block-at-edge ingress:
  cheap policies → Subscription enrichment (`SubscriptionClient.get_by_msisdn`) →
  post-enrich policies → persist `usage_event` + inline-publish `usage.recorded`.
  Rejections leave **no** row, only a `usage.rejected` audit trace. First
  service-owned table write of the port. Live smoke proves the rejection path
  in-network + a `usage.rejected` row against live Subscription.
- **`rust/services/provisioning-sim`** — HLR/PCRF/OCS/SM-DP+ stand-in. Consumer +
  fault-injecting worker (`fail_always`/`fail_first_attempt`/`slow`/`stuck`) +
  the eSIM SM-DP+ seam (`sim`/`onbglobal`/`esim_access` — `select_esim_provider`
  fail-fast). The stateful retry loop mutates an in-memory task and persists once
  at the terminal state (externally identical to the Python flush-then-commit).
  Live smoke: worker completes `HLR_PROVISION` → `provisioning.task.completed`;
  deployed container drains the live `provisioning.task.created` queue.
- **`rust/services/som`** — the event-plane heart. Decomposes `order.in_progress`
  → ServiceOrder → CFS → RFS(Data,Voice) + atomic MSISDN/eSIM reservation
  (`InventoryClient`), drives `provisioning.task.*` to `service_order.completed`.
  Runs the **outbox relay** (its staged events' only publisher) and **four safe
  consumers**. Live smoke: HTTP surface + the relay drains a staged row to
  published against the live broker.

- **Platform crates grown (the deferred P0/P1 bindings, now validated):**
  - **`bss-events::start_relay` / `Relay` / `drain_once`** — the lapin/sqlx tick
    loop over the P0 `drain_batch` core: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` drain →
    publish-with-`message_id` → mark, at-least-once. **som/com/subscription run
    it; the rest inline-publish.**
  - **`bss-events::bind_consumer` + `EventHandler`** — the safe consumer: declares
    the main/retry/parked topology (arg types matched aio-pika so the durable
    queues are shared byte-identically), inbox-dedups on `message_id`, runs the
    handler on the consumer's transaction, retries (TTL dead-letter) or parks. It
    processes deliveries **serially** — see the concurrency note below.
  - **`bss-events::MqChannel`** grew `publish_json_with_id`/`publish_bytes_with_id`,
    `declare_retry_exchange`, `bind_safe_consumer`, `publish_parked`.
  - **`bss-clients::{SubscriptionClient, InventoryClient}`** — the two typed
    clients this phase needs (by-msisdn lookup; reserve/release MSISDN + eSIM).
  - **`bss-admin` (new crate)** — the shared `admin_reset_router` (operational-data
    wipe, `BSS_ALLOW_ADMIN_RESET`-gated). Ported here because the Phase-2 scenarios
    call each service's `/reset-operational-data`. All three services mount it.
  - **`bss-clock::isoformat`** — Python `datetime.isoformat()` parity (micros, no
    fraction when zero, `+00:00`). The first R1 datetime-in-payload seam.

### Cutover into the running stack (per Decision D8)

All three run their Rust image via `docker-compose.rust.yml`
(`bss-{mediation,provisioning-sim,som}:rust`). Each verified in-network through the
deployed container (mediation reached `subscription:8000`; provisioning-sim drained
a published `task.created` → `completed` published_to_mq=true; som's 4 consumers +
relay started clean). The overlay ledger now reads rating + all three.

### The P1 order→provisioning "stall" — it was a misrun, not a bug

P1 deferred the full hero suite because `customer_signup_and_exhaust` stalled at
"wait for order to complete" (`order.stuck`). **The real cause was the P1 run
itself** — no `make scenarios-hero` provider-flip wrapper (payment still Stripe →
the charge never approved → no activation) + empty seed. Proof: the full
`scenarios-hero` suite passes on the **pure Python** event plane (verified — the
first P2 run tested Python som/prov before I noticed they'd been reverted, see the
deployment gotcha), and the Rust event plane passes the same scenarios (verified —
below). It was never a code stall.

**Separately**, while porting SOM I found a *real latent* concurrency bug in the
oracle: `handle_task_completed` does a read-modify-write on the CFS `characteristics`
JSONB (`pendingTasks[t]=completed`) with **no row lock**, and the Python aio-pika
consumer runs its callbacks **concurrently** (prefetch 5) — four simultaneous
`provisioning.task.completed` events *can* lose a `pendingTasks` update. It doesn't
manifest in the hero run (the four provisioning tasks have staggered durations, so
the completions arrive spaced out), but it's a genuine race. The Rust port hardens
it: the safe consumer processes deliveries serially and the handlers read the CFS
`FOR UPDATE`. **Noted for a Python backport** — a correctness improvement, not the
P1-stall fix.

### Exit criteria — met (validated against the confirmed Rust event plane)

Six event-plane hero scenarios run **directly** (`bss scenario run <file>`) with the
four Rust containers confirmed deployed throughout (payment flipped to mock; the
overlay held so som/provisioning-sim stayed Rust):

- `new_activation_with_provisioning_retry` ✅ (provisioning-retry-resilience — order
  completes *despite* the injected HLR fault; the retry path runs through Rust
  provisioning-sim + som) and `inventory_low_watermark_and_replenishment` ✅ — the
  two named exit criteria.
- `customer_signup_and_exhaust` ✅ 13/13, `trace_customer_signup_swimlane` ✅ (order
  completes in ~2.6s), `customer_buys_roaming_and_uses_it` ✅ (mediation roaming
  path), `customer_renews_automatically` ✅.
- Retry path exercised by the retry scenario; park-after-max is unit-pinned
  (`decide_retry`) and the topology declares the parked queue.

### Deployment gotcha (important for P3+ and P8)

`make scenarios-hero` recreates `portal-self-serve` (email-provider flip) with the
**base** compose file. `portal-self-serve` has a health-gated `depends_on:
[som, provisioning-sim, …]`, so compose reconciles those deps against the base spec
and **reverts the Rust som/provisioning-sim containers to Python** — because the
distroless Rust images carry **no `HEALTHCHECK`** (that's the Phase-8 "healthchecks
without curl" task). So `make scenarios-hero` as-is silently tests the Python event
plane. Until the Rust images get a healthcheck, validate with **`COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.rust.yml`** exported (so every wrapper `docker compose`
keeps the overlay), or run the api-tagged event-plane scenarios directly with the
overlay held (what was done here). The 4 portal-tagged hero scenarios still need the
portal and are out of scope for the Rust event-plane validation.

### Bugs caught by the deployed cutover (playbook §7)

- **`NOT_ALLOWED - attempt to reuse consumer tag 'som'`** — all four SOM consumers
  shared one consumer tag on one connection; RabbitMQ requires unique tags (aio-pika
  auto-generates them). Fixed: the (unique) queue name is the tag.
- **Nanosecond datetime drift** — mediation's `rejectedAt` serialized 9-digit
  nanoseconds vs Python's 6-digit micros. Fixed via `bss_clock::isoformat` (R1 seam).

## Phase 1 — Pilot: rating — ✅ COMPLETE (tag `v2.0.0-phase.1`)

The first Python service ported to Rust, and the **per-service porting playbook**
([`PLAYBOOK.md`](PLAYBOOK.md)) — the real Phase-1 deliverable — validated by
stamping it once. Proven end-to-end against the **live stack**: the Rust rating
service, as the sole consumer of `rating.usage.recorded`, turned a
`usage.recorded` into a `usage.rated` (audit row + published to MQ) via the live
Catalog and live Postgres. 96 unit/integration tests green (12 new for rating),
5 `#[ignore]` live-smoke checks green against the running stack; fmt + clippy
`-D warnings` clean.

### Done

- **`rust/services/rating`** (lib + bin) — port of `services/rating`:
  - **`domain.rs`** — pure `rate_usage` (over `serde_json::Value` tariff, faithful
    dict-shape reads) + `decide_usage_outcome` (the consumer's roaming-routing
    branch factored out as a pure fn so the full event-shape decision is CI-testable).
    12 unit tests port `test_rating_pure_function.py` + the payload assertions of
    `test_rating_event_consumer.py` 1:1 (error-substring matched for wire stability).
  - **HTTP** (`routes.rs` + `error.rs` + `lib.rs::create_app`) — `/health` (exempt)
    + `/ready` (token-required — only `/health*` is exempt, matching the oracle),
    `/rating-api/v1/{tariff/{id},rate-test}`, mounts `clock_admin_router` +
    `audit_events_router`. `ApiError` `IntoResponse` reproduces the ASGI middleware
    shapes (`RatingError`→422 `{code:"RATING_ERROR"}`, upstream 5xx→500, 404).
    axum-0.7 `:param` paths; token gate outermost, context inside.
  - **`consumer.rs`** — lapin consume loop on `usage.recorded`; inline-publish
    (rating runs **no** relay — only subscription/com/som do); publish-then-INSERT
    with resolved `published_to_mq`; consumer rows stamped from `RequestCtx::default()`
    (Python `auth_context` default). Acks unconditionally (handler owns its errors).
  - **`config.rs`** — `Settings::from_env()` (`BSS_<UPPER>`), sqlx DB-url normalize.
  - **`Dockerfile`** — multi-stage, distroless-cc final, non-root, port 8000.

- **Platform crates grown (reused by P2+):**
  - **`bss-clients::CatalogClient`** — first typed client (`get_offering`); thin
    wrapper over `BssClient`, only the call rating needs.
  - **`bss-events::audit_events_router(pool)`** — the shared `/audit-api/v1` read
    router (dynamic filters via `QueryBuilder`, camelCase out, ISO 422). Was
    deferred from P0; lands here where a service mounts it.
  - **`bss-events::MqChannel`** — lapin connect / declare `bss.events` topic
    exchange / `publish_json` (inline-publish parity, no `message_id`) /
    `declare_and_bind`. Runs lapin on the tokio runtime via the `tokio-*-trait`
    shims. **vhost fix:** an AMQP URL ending in bare `/` (empty vhost to lapin,
    default `/` to aio-pika) is normalized to `%2f`.
  - Workspace: `lapin` + `tokio-executor-trait`/`tokio-reactor-trait`/`futures-util`
    added; `bss-clients`/`bss-models` path deps + `services/*` member glob.

- **Live proof** (`services/rating/tests/live_smoke.rs`, `#[ignore]`, 4 checks) —
  the Phase-1 analogue of the P0 conformance harness, all **inert / cleaned up**:
  1. `CatalogClient` ↔ live Catalog + `rate_usage` on the **real** PLAN_M (caught
     the R1 shape: live PLAN_M carries `data_roaming`, `taxIncludedAmount.value`
     is a number, currency is `.unit`);
  2. full HTTP stack (health / authed tariff / 401 / rate-test / 422 / audit read)
     against live infra via in-process `axum::serve`;
  3. outbox INSERT + audit read-back for an inert aggregate, then `DELETE`;
  4. **consumer cutover** — `docker stop bss-cli-rating-1`, Rust binary drains the
     shared durable queue, publish one synthetic `usage.recorded` (non-existent
     sub → subscription catches-and-acks, no side effect), assert the Rust-written
     `usage.rated` (`published_to_mq=true`), clean up, `trap`-restart the container.

### Cutover into the running stack (per Decision D8, 2026-07-11)

Rating is **cut over in the running compose stack**, not just proven in isolation —
per the per-service cutover doctrine (D8: cut over at each phase, running stack;
oracle stays reproducible-on-demand).

- **Image + overlay:** `docker build -f rust/services/rating/Dockerfile -t
  bss-rating:rust rust/`; swapped in via `docker-compose.rust.yml`
  (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rust.yml up -d rating`).
  `bss-cli-rating-1` now runs `bss-rating:rust` (health reports version `1.8.1`,
  the Rust `BSS_RELEASE`, vs the Python image's `1.7.0`).
- **Mixed-stack functional proof:** published a real `usage.recorded` to the live
  `bss.events` exchange; the **deployed Rust container** consumed it, reached
  `catalog:8000` **over the compose network** (the real in-network path the host
  binary couldn't exercise), rated it, and wrote `usage.rated` (`published_to_mq=
  true`, `allowanceType=data`, `qty=250`, `charge=0`, `actor=system`,
  `service_identity=default`). Clean `INFO` logs; inert row cleaned up.
- **Bug caught at the deployed container (log review):** the tracing subscriber had
  no level filter → `lapin` logged at TRACE and **dumped the AMQP PLAIN handshake
  (broker password) into the logs**. Fixed in `bss_telemetry::init_telemetry`
  (default `info`; `lapin`/`amq_protocol*` pinned to `warn`; never default TRACE).
  Rebuilt + re-swapped; 0 leaky lines. This is exactly the class of error the
  per-service cutover is meant to surface early — logged in the playbook (§7).
- **Full hero suite (`make scenarios-hero`) not yet run — and why:** the running
  stack's operational data is currently empty (an `operational_data_reset`), and
  the full `customer_signup_and_exhaust` / `customer_buys_roaming_and_uses_it`
  scenarios need `make scenarios-hero`'s provider-flip wrapper (payment→mock,
  kyc→prebaked, email→logging + container recreation) plus a healthy order→
  provisioning path. A direct baseline run stuck at **order completion** —
  provisioning tasks all `completed`, but the som/com completion-event reaction
  didn't flip the order (`order.stuck`) — and it stuck the **same way on the pure
  Python stack** (pre-swap baseline), so it is a stack/data-state issue upstream of
  rating, not the port. Rating's own responsibility is validated by the mixed-stack
  event-path proof above; the full suite is a heavier, stack-reconfiguring step to
  run deliberately (with the wrapper + a seed) once the provisioning path is healthy.

### Deferred (by design, land where they're validated by real behaviour)

- The **relay tick loop** lapin/sqlx binding (drain→publish→mark) — only
  subscription/com/som run it, so it lands in P2/P3 against the real retry/park
  topology + the provisioning-retry hero scenario. The relay *core* (SQL, drain
  orchestration) already exists in `bss-events` from P0.
- The **compose image-swap** run of `make scenarios-hero` — the Dockerfile lands
  now; the container build + mixed-stack scenario sweep is the P8 image pass. The
  consumer cutover smoke already proves the runtime path against the live stack.
- Remaining `CatalogClient` surface (list/price/promotions/admin) — ports when
  Catalog itself lands (P3) or a consumer first needs a call.

### Notes / decisions taken

- **Local topology discovered:** the bss **app** containers run locally (published
  `localhost:8001`–`:8010`); the **infra** (Postgres/RabbitMQ/Jaeger) runs on the
  remote `tech-vm` over Tailscale. Point `BSS_CATALOG_URL=http://localhost:8001`
  for the live smoke; DB/MQ use the `.env` `tech-vm` URLs.
- **Consumer decision extracted as a pure fn** (`decide_usage_outcome`) is the
  reusable pattern — it moves the event-shape spec into CI without infra. Baked
  into the playbook.

## Phase 0 — Foundations — ✅ COMPLETE (tag `v2.0.0-phase.0`)

All exit criteria green against the live oracle via `cargo run -p conformance`
(2026-07-11): token-middleware conformance, an audit row the **Python** relay
publishes, a Rust-emitted trace in **Jaeger**, and golden HMAC vectors matching
the oracle. 8 platform crates + conformance harness; 84 unit tests + 5 live
checks; clippy `-D warnings` + fmt clean; CI wired.

Goal: Cargo workspace + CI + the seven platform crates against a throwaway
hello-world service (see `03-PHASES.md`).

### Done

- **Python baseline captured** → [`05-BASELINE.md`](05-BASELINE.md). The "before"
  measurement for motto #6, taken while the Python stack was live (it can't be
  reconstructed post-cutover). Headlines: **1.18 GiB** app-plane RAM (11
  containers), **6.36 s** full-stack cold start (all 11 booted together;
  per-service breakdown in the doc), **12.8 ms** p99 on `/health`, **~3.46 GB**
  nominal image sum, **109,297** LOC Python. Phase 8 re-measures the same way
  (§6 of that doc) and this is the comparison point.
- **Toolchain + scaffold.** rustup stable (1.97) with rustfmt + clippy. Cargo
  workspace at `rust/` (D7: subtree, not standalone repo — rationale in
  `rust/README.md`). Workspace lints: `unsafe_code = forbid`,
  clippy `unwrap_used`/`expect_used = warn` (promoted to deny by `-D warnings`).
- **CI from day one.** `.github/workflows/rust.yml` — fmt + clippy `-D warnings`
  + test on `2.0` pushes / PRs touching `rust/**`. (Closes the "no CI anywhere"
  gap the inventory flagged; sqlx-prepare job added when `bss-db` lands.)
- **`bss-clock`** (first crate — "everything reads it"). Faithful port of
  `packages/bss-clock`:
  - `now/freeze/unfreeze/advance/state/parse_duration/reset_for_tests`, wall &
    frozen modes. Process-global state via `ArcSwap<Inner>` with `rcu` writers
    (§2.2 of `02-TECH-MAPPING.md`) → lock-free `now()` reads.
  - `clock_admin_router()` (axum) mirrors the FastAPI router: `GET /clock/now`
    unguarded; `POST freeze|unfreeze|advance` gated on `BSS_ALLOW_ADMIN_RESET`;
    camelCase wire shape (`offsetSeconds`/`frozenAt`), RFC-3339 instants,
    `{"detail":{code,message}}` errors, 403/422 parity.
  - 15 integration tests porting `tests/test_clock.py` 1:1 (serialized on a
    process-global `Mutex` since the clock is a singleton). All green; fmt +
    clippy clean.

- **`bss-context`** — the §2.1 ContextVar translation. Unifies the Python
  per-service `auth_context.AuthContext` **and** `bss_clients.base` context vars
  into one `RequestCtx` (actor/tenant/channel/service_identity/request_id + roles/
  permissions, defaults matching the dataclass). Carried explicitly in axum
  extensions (`Extension<RequestCtx>`) *and* mirrored into a `tokio::task_local!`
  scope for the two chokepoint readers (bss-clients, bss-events) — the task-local
  lives only in this crate (future doctrine guard). `propagate_context` middleware
  ports `RequestIdMiddleware` (header→ctx, echo `x-request-id`); `service_identity`
  comes from a `ServiceIdentity` extension the token layer will set, never a header
  (guard #6 made structural). 10 tests (ports `test_auth_context.py` +
  `test_header_propagation.py` intent + task isolation); fmt + clippy clean.
  - Deferred: the `set_service_identity_token` per-call override becomes an explicit
    field on the orchestrator tool-context in P5 (§2.1), not a task-local — noted so
    bss-clients doesn't reach for one.

- **`bss-middleware`** — perimeter `X-BSS-API-Token` auth (risk R4). `TokenMap`
  (HMAC-SHA-256 via `hmac`+`sha2`, constant-time full-scan lookup via `subtle`,
  env-name→identity derivation), loader + validator (default-required, unique
  identities/tokens, sentinel/length), and the axum `require_api_token` gate
  (`/health*` + `/webhooks/` exemptions, 401 shapes). Wires to bss-context: the
  gate inserts `ServiceIdentity` (guard #6 — identity from the token only, never a
  header), the context layer reads it — proven by a composed layer test.
  - **Golden-vector conformance**: captured HMAC digests + identity derivations
    from the live Python oracle → `tests/golden_vectors.json`; two Rust tests
    assert byte-identical hashing/derivation. This is the R4 mitigation.
  - 28 tests (port `test_api_token.py` + `test_token_auth.py` + golden). Deferred:
    the per-`(remote,path)` 401 log throttle (observability; lands with bss-telemetry).

- **`bss-db`** — the `PolicyViolation` type (the single most load-bearing payload;
  the LLM reads it) + sqlx pool. Ports `policies/base.PolicyViolation` (raise side,
  field `rule`), the `RequestIdMiddleware` 422 serialization (wire side: `rule`→
  `reason` + derived `referenceError`, five keys exactly), and the client parse
  (`bss_clients.base._handle_response`) as `from_wire`. `IntoResponse` makes the
  422 contract compiler-enforced. sqlx `PgPool` with the SQLAlchemy 5+5 config
  (`connect`). 7 tests pin the exact wire shape + server→client round-trip.
  - Deferred: a live-captured golden 422 from the running stack can augment the
    hand-pinned shape once the conformance service exists.
- **`bss-models`** (started) — `BSS_RELEASE` single source of truth (guard #14),
  tracking the Python baseline `1.8.1`. The ~60 per-table `FromRow` structs are
  intentionally deferred: each ports **with its service** (P1–P4) against that
  service's golden contract tests, where the R1 dict-shape hazards concentrate.

- **`bss-clients`** (base done) — the reqwest S2S base. Ports `BSSClient`:
  mandatory per-request timeouts, **no retries**, typed `ClientError` (404→NotFound,
  422+POLICY_VIOLATION→`Policy(bss_db::PolicyViolation)` reusing that type, other
  422/4xx→Http, 5xx→Server, timeout, transport). `AuthProvider` trait +
  No/Token/Bearer/NamedToken (fail-fast constructors; NamedToken primary→fallback
  env). Context propagation reads `bss_context::current().outbound_headers()` with
  set-default semantics — **no `set_context`**, the §2.1 unification pays off. 11
  tests run the real reqwest path against a local axum peer (respx equivalent):
  error mapping, no-retry (call-count=1), per-call timeout, auth+ctx headers.
  - Deferred: the 12 typed clients (CRMClient, …) port per-phase (P1–P4); the
    per-call service-identity token override lands with the orchestrator (P5, §2.1).

- **`bss-telemetry`** (rules done) — the two pure, load-bearing pieces: the
  log-field **redaction** rules (`REDACTED_KEYS` minus `_ref`/`_id` suffixes →
  `***REDACTED***`, top-level keys only, no recursion — ports `redact_sensitive`)
  and the **semconv** span attribute keys (`bss.*`, last4-only discipline). 4 tests.
  - Deferred to the conformance-service step: the tracing-subscriber JSON setup,
    the OTLP/OTel exporter, and the tracing `Layer` that applies `redact_event` to
    live events (validated against Jaeger there) — "instrument at the chokepoint".

- **`bss-events`** (core done) — the transactional-outbox plane, broker-free core:
  - `stage_event` builds the `audit.domain_event` row stamped from `RequestCtx` +
    `bss_clock::now()` (ports `events/publisher.publish`); `published_to_mq=false`.
  - `drain_batch` — the relay orchestration (publish→mark, at-least-once, null
    payload→`{}`) over an `EventPublisher` trait; tested against a fake. The
    `DRAIN_SQL`/`MARK_OK_SQL`/`MARK_FAIL_SQL` are verbatim (SKIP LOCKED, oldest
    first). `relay_mode(None)=Off` (delivery off, log still records).
  - `decide_retry` (park at `>= max_retries`, else nack-retry) + `death_count`
    (`x-death[0].count`) — the safe-consumer decision, plus `CLAIM_INBOX_SQL`.
  - `topology` — the frozen RabbitMQ contract as assertable data (exchange names,
    main/retry queue args, parked/retry names) so a Rust and a Python service share
    a broker byte-identically during migration.
  - 8 tests (port `test_relay.py` + `test_consumer.py` intent + contract pins).
  - Deferred to conformance: lapin connect/declare/consume, the sqlx tick loop, and
    the `/audit-api/v1` read router (needs Postgres+RabbitMQ to validate).

- **`conformance` harness** (`rust/conformance`, `cargo run -p conformance`) — the
  Phase-0 exit harness, run against the **live stack** (Postgres/RabbitMQ on
  `tech-vm`, the same infra the Python services use; reachable from the dev host
  over Tailscale). Never runs in CI. **All checks green (2026-07-11):**
  - sqlx connects to the live Postgres (16.14).
  - `audit.domain_event` schema matches `bss_events::DomainEvent` (16/16 columns).
  - **cross-language outbox interop: the *Python* relay published a Rust-written
    audit row** — INSERT an inert `conformance.ping` (no consumer bound), poll until
    `published_to_mq` flips, then DELETE. Zero side effects.
  - token middleware end-to-end over real HTTP with the live `BSS_API_TOKEN`
    (health 200 / no-token 401 / valid-token 200, identity=`default`).
  - Component model confirmed for the human: sqlx/lapin/reqwest/otel are libraries
    compiled into the binary — **no new infra, nothing to deploy**; Rust reuses the
    existing Postgres/RabbitMQ/Jaeger. (D-note in `rust/README.md`.)

- **`bss-telemetry` OTel bootstrap** — `init_telemetry(service)` builds a
  `TracerProvider` with an OTLP/HTTP-protobuf exporter to the same Jaeger the
  Python stack uses (`service.name = bss-<service>`, `TraceIdRatioBased` sampler,
  batch export), bridges `tracing` spans via tracing-opentelemetry, adds a JSON
  log layer, and never panics (falls back to logs-only). `TelemetryGuard` flushes
  on drop. `emit_probe_span` returns a trace id for the Jaeger conformance check.
  opentelemetry 0.27.x pinned (R6 version-matrix resolved cleanly).
  - One follow-up: the redaction **Layer** over live `tracing` fields (the rules +
    `redact_event` exist; wiring them as a fmt field-visitor lands when the first
    service logs sensitive fields — no service does yet).

### Phase 0 done → Phase 1 (rating pilot)

Tagged `v2.0.0-phase.0`. Next: **Phase 1 — port the rating service** (smallest,
"rating is a pure function"), the pilot that turns the platform crates into a
running Rust service and produces the per-service porting playbook. This is where
the per-endpoint golden-contract capture rig gets fleshed out (capture rating's
request/response/event JSON from the Python oracle, diff the Rust service against
it), and where bss-clients' first typed client (catalog) + the lapin/sqlx service
wiring (relay tick loop, consumer, `/audit-api/v1` router) land.

### Notes / decisions taken

- **Deps pinned minimal:** chrono, arc-swap, serde_json, axum (+ tokio/tower dev).
  No `regex` — `parse_duration` is hand-rolled to match `^\s*(\d+)\s*([smhd])\s*$`
  without the dependency.
- Clock tests need `--test-threads` safety: solved in-crate with a serialising
  `Mutex` + `reset_for_tests()`, not by constraining the runner.
